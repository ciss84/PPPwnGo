illustrate:
- .Net2.0、32 or 64bit、Win>=7 

- Just demo, don’t have too high expectations, the current overall success rate is not high. The success rates vary between different versions. Please wait patiently~

- If pppwn.py is updated later, there is no need to update the exe. Directly overwrite "pppwn.py"、 "offsets.py" in the main directory & bin of “PS4_stage_bin_all”folder

Step：
1. Open the "Python!" folder and install all（install the latest version of python）
2. Open the "PS4_GoldHEN_all" folder, put the corresponding version of goldhen.bin into the root directory of the exfat format U disk, and insert it into the PS4
3. Connect PS4 and PC using a network cable, enter PS4 Settings-Network-Set Internet Connection-Use Lan-Customize-PPPOE, and fill in a name and password.
4. Run "PPPwnGo.exe", select the PS4 version and the corresponding network card, generally the default is fine (unless you have multiple network cards), click the "Go" button
5. Click to enter "Test Internet" in the PS4 network
6. When the execution is completed, "done" will be displayed, and "PPPwn" will pop up in the upper left corner of PS4. If it is stuck, fails, crashes or loses power, repeat 4&5，if it fails more than 3 times in a row, please  turn the PS4 network switch back on or restart PS4

Tip: A little trick that can improve the success rate. After failure, first turn off the network switch of PS4 or disconnect the network cable, then turn it on and try again！
